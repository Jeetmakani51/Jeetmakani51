## Hi there 👋

I am Jeet, i am a computer science student based in India.

I like to build cool projects, some for me and some to help others.

I am an introvert who rarely comes out of his room and talks to people.

I mostly spend my time making projects, reading books, daydreaming and helping my mom in household chores(whenever i am home).

My main tech stack is c++, javascript(still learning),java,python, html, css or scss.

I have created a bunch of projects in my pc but uploaded only those which are good.

I am really looking forward to make friends who have same interest in tech as me and create a community to help each other in projects.

Feel free to contribute in my projects and reach out to me.

**FUN FACTS:**

-> I like to read and collect books.

-> I am a very nostalgic person.

-> Naruto is my favourite anime.

-> hobbies : gym, anime, daydreaming, building things
